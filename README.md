## ble-multimeter-app
Used to provide remote access to the MP730624 multimeter display

To use, click here --> [ble-multimeter-app](https://shabaz123.github.io/MP730624_tools/ble-multimeter-app/)

If you're on Android and wish to optionally install the app, click on the Install pop-up that appears when you go to that page. If the pop-up does not appear, then click on the top-right **three-dots menu** in Android Chrome, and then select **Install App** in the drop-down menu.

Please check each range makes sense before relying on the app! Iâ€™m not liable for any issues, the code is for free with no guarantee, and is intended for engineers, to evaluate themselves.

***NOTE*** It is preferable to use Chrome, or perhaps Chrome-based browsers! It ***may*** run on other browsers. The reason is, it uses the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API), which is not supported on all web browsers.

In particular, the Web Bluetooth API doesn't seem to be supported on Apple mobile devices (iPhone and iPad). However, there is a good workaround for Apple mobile products. The solution is to download an alternative browser from the Apple mobile store, called [WebBLE](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webble/id1193531073) . That supports the Web Bluetooth API. It costs $1.99. To use it, launch that app, and then tap near the top of the page in order to bring up an address bar. Then, it behaves like a normal web browser and you can click on the same link as mentioned earlier, i.e.:
